# ImgHash Viewer

ImgHash Viewer is a small UI application that helps to work with Image hashes like Average Hash, Difference Hash or Perceptual Hash powered by [`imghash-rs`](https://github.com/YannickAlex07/imghash-rs). It allows one to visualize the different hashes as well as the different intermediate steps that the different algorithms take to compute the hash.
